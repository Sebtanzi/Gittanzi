Chapter 2
Personal security and Risk management Concepts

======================================================================================================================
Personal security policies
	job description = first description of security needs
	seperation of duties = critical, significant and sensitive work tasks are divided among several individual admin
	Job responsabilities = specific work tasks an employee is required to perform ona regular basis	
	Job rotation = rotatins employees among multiple job positions
	collusion = several people work together to perpetrate a crime

Risk Terminology
	Asset = anything within an environment that should be protected
	Asset Valuation	= dollar value assigned to an asset
	Threats	= potential occurrence that may cause to undesirable outcome for an org or for aspecific asset
	threats agents = people or programs, HW, systems
	threats events = accidental and intentional exploitations of vulnerabilities
	Vulnerability = weakness in an asset or weakness (or abscence) of a safeguard or countermeasure
	Exposure = being susceptible to asset loss because of a threat
	Risk = possibility that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to an asset
	Safeguards (or countermeasures)	= anything that removes or reduces vulnerabilities against specific threat(s)
	Attack = exploitation of a vulnerability by a threat agent
	Breach = occurence of a security mechanism being bypassed by a threat agent

4 possible response to risk
	reduce or mitigate = implementing of safeguards
	assign or transfer (insurance and outsourcing)
	accept = risk tolerance or risk apetite (valuation by management of the cost/benefice analysis)
	reject or ignore = unacceptable possible response

Residual risk = risk remaining after implementing safeguards
Total risk = threats * vulnerabilities * asset values
total risk - controls gap = Residual risk

Types of control
	deterrent = deployed to discourage violation of security policies
	preventive = stop unwanted on unauthorized activity from occuring
	detective = discover detect unwanted activity
	compensating = provide various options to other existing controls
	corrective = modifies the environment to return systems to normal after an unwanted activity
	recovery = extension of corrective controls, but more advanced and complex
	Directive = direct, confine, or control the actions of subjects to force compliance to security policy

Quantitative risk analysis
	= concrete probability percentages
	1.Assign Asset Value (AV), in $		
	2.Exposure Factor (EF) = loss potential, in %
	3.calculate single loss expectancy (SLE), in $, SLE = AV * EF
	4.Assess the annualized rate of occurence (ARO), = probability determination, in unit/year
	5.Derive the annualized loss expectancy (ALE), in $/year, ALE = ARO * SLE
	6.Perform cost/benefit analysis of countermeasures, needs calculate new ALE with implemented countermeasure
		(safeguard often reduce ARO, not AV nor EF)
		-> Annual Cost of Safeguard (ACS) = ALE before safeguard - ALE after implementing safeguards

6 step RMF (Risk Management Framework)
	1.security categorization based on impact analysis
	2.security control selection = initial set of baseline security control
	3.security control implementation = describe how
	4.security control assessment = 
	5.information system assessment (FR=evaluation)
	6.security control monitoring

Chapitre 3:
Business Continuity Planning

BCP 4 main steps:
	Project scope and planning
	Business impact assessment
	Continuity Planning
	Approval and implementation

Project scope and planning
	requires:
		structured analysis from crisis planning point of view
		creation of BCP team approved by senior management
		assessment of the resources available
		analysis of the legal and regulatory landspace

Business impact assessment (BIA)
	Quantitative decision making = numbers and formulas to reach a decision
	Qualitative Decision Making = takes non-numerical factors, like emotions, investor/customer confidence, workforce stability
		leads to categories of prioritizations (high/medium/low)

	set up the MTD and RTO (Recover Time Objective): goal of BCP: RTO < MTD

	SLE = AV * EF
	ALE = SLE * ARO
	ALE = AV * EF * ARO

Continuity Planning
	Strategy development = bridges gap between the business impact assessment and the continuity planning phases of BCP dev
	
Plan Approval = needs top-level endorsement of the plan
	Plan Implementation = BCP team should supervise the conduct of an appropriate BCP maintenance program

Chapter 5
Protecting Security Assets

============================================================================================================
7 principles to opt for US company to the EU program:
	Notice: org must inform individuals aout the purpouse of collecting data
	Choice: org must offer opportunity to opt out
	Onward transfer: org can only transfer data to other than organizations that comply with Notice et Choice principles
	Security: must take reasonable precautions to protect data
	Data integrity: must insure data is reliable
	Access: individuals must have access to personal information that the org holds
	Enforcement: org must assure compliance with the principles

Symmetric cryto
	Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) = most popular symmetric encryption algorithm, 112b 168b or 256b
	Triple DES (or 3DES) uses 56-bits key but newer use 112-bits or 168-bits
	Blowfish uses 32 bits to 448 bits adds 128 additional bits as a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks

Transport Encryption
	HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) uses Transport Layer Security (TLS)
	Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) = presursor of TLS = created by Netscape, sensible to POODLE
	VPN Virtual Private Network uses TLS and IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)
	SSH Secure Shell = strong encryption protocol included in Secure Copy (SCP) and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
		=/= FTP transmits data in cleartext

Identifying Data roles (NIST SP 800-18)
	Data owners = person who has ultimate organization responsability for data
	System Owners = person who owns the system that processes sensitive data
	Business/Mission Owners = overlap with the responsabilities of the system owner or bet the same role
	Data Processors = any system used to process data or person that controls the process of data
	Administrators = responsible for granting appropriate access to personnel
	Custodians = helps protect the integrity and security of data
	User = any person who access data to accomplish work task

Defining Classifications
	Government data classifications:
		top secret = disclosure cause exceptionnaly grave damage to national security
		Secret = disclosure cause serious damage to national security
		Confidential = disclorue cause damage to national security
		Unclassified = not top secret, or scret or confidential = available to anyone
			
	Non government classifications:	
		Class 3 to Class 0
		Confidential (or Proprietary) = Class 3 = Top secret
		Private = Classe 2 = Secret
		Sensitive = Class 1 = Confidential
		Public = Classe 0 = Unclassified

	Confidential or Proprietary = disclosure cause exceptionally grave damage to the mission of org
	Private	= should stay private but doesn't meet Confidential definition
	Sensitive = disclosure could cause damage to the org
	Public = unclassified = posted in web site, brochure, or any public source, but need integrity (no modification from outside)

Destroying sensitive Data
	Erasing = delete operation against a file, or selection of files, or entire media
	Clearing (or overwriting) = process of preparing media for reuse
				1. First character = 	1010 0001
				2. Complement =		0101 1110
				3. Random bits =	1101 0100
	Purging = more intense clearing that prepares media for reuse in less secure environment
	Declassification = purges media or system in preparation to reuse in a unclassified environment
	Sanitization = combination of processes that removes data from a system or from media
	Degaussing = creating a strong magnetic field that erases data on some media
	Destruction = inciniration, crushing, shredding, disintegration, disolving

Chapitre 6:
Cryptography and Symmetric Key Algorithms
			
=======================================================================================================================================================
Goals of Crypto
	Confidentiality	= data remains private white at rest or in transit (= in the wire, refers to network cables)
	Integrity = ensures data not altered without authourization
	Authentication = verify claimed identity of system users
	Nonrepudiation = assure the recipient that the message is originated by the sendor

Concepts
	plaintext (P) message = message before put into coded form
	encrypt = uses a cryptoalgorithm to code the plaintext message and create a ciphertext (C) message		
	Keys = cryptoalgorithm uses keys to maintain their security
	Key space = range of value that are valid for use as a key for a specific algorithm
	Bit Size = key space in difined by bit size, number of binary bits in the key
	algorithm = set of rules, usually mathematical, that dictates how to enciphering and deciphering processes

Boolean Mathematics
	AND = symbol ^
	OR = symbol inversed of AND
	NOT = symbol ~
	EXCLUSIVE OR (or XOR) = circled + : 0+0=0, 1+1=0, 1+0=1
	Modulo function = symbol mod = symbol %

Cryptographic Mathematics
	One way functions = mathematical operation, makes impossible to retrieve input produced based on the output
	Nonce = random number that acts as a placeholder variable in mathematical functions, ex: IV
	Zero-knowledge proof = prove your knowledge of a fact to a third party without revealing the fact
	Split Knowledge = information divided among multiple users, see key escrow database
	Transposition Ciphers = rearrange the letter in a plaintext message, ex.: apple > elppa
	Substitution ciphers = replaces each character or bit with a different character, ex.: ROT3 > C = (P+3) mod 26
	One-Time pads (or Vernam ciphers): uses a different substitution for each letter, key lenght = N (1 for Caesar)
	Running key cipher (or book Cipher) = use a book to get the key
	Block Cipher = operates on "chunks"
	Stream Ciphers = operates on one character or bit at a time, ex.: caesar cipher
	Confusion = complexe relationship between P and the key, cant get the key by altering P and analyze C
	Diffusion = a change in the P results in multiple changes spread throughout the ciphertext

Modern Crypto:
	Symmetric Key algorithm: rely on "shared secret" to encrypt and decrypt data
		key distribution = major problem, need out-of-band exchange
		does not implement non-repudiation
		not scalable
		very fast
		key requirement: n*(n-1)/2

	Asymmetric key algo (or public key algo): each user: 1 public shared with all users, 1 private kept secret
		assures digital signature techno
		provide integrity, authentication and non repudiation
		scalable: user easy to delete and new user needs only one pair of keys / no preexisting comm needed / 
		very slow
		key requirement: n*2

	Hashing Algorithm = summaries of the message's content
		MD2/MD5 (Message Digest)
		SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm)
		HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code)

		Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB) = streaming cipher version of CBC, operates in real time
		Output Feedback Mode (OFB) = XORs block text with seed value instead of previous ciphered block
		Counter Mode (CTR) = uses a stream cipher similar to CFB and OFB, simple incrementing counter
	3DES = 	triple DES
		DES-EEE3 mode:first encrypts plain text three times, using K1, K2, K3, key lenght: 168bits long
		DES-EDE3 mode:C = E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,P))), 2nd op = decrypt, key lenght: 168bits long
		DES-EEE2 mode:uses 2keys, C = E(K1,E(K2,E(K1,P))), key lenght: 112bits long					
		DES-EDE2 mode: uses 2 keys and replace encryption in second operation by decryption

Subject = user or process that makes the request to access a ressource
Object = ressource that the subject wants to access
transitive trust: if A trust B and B trusts C, then A trusts C

closed system = work well with a narrow range of other systems, generally from the same manufacturer
open system = use agreed-upon industry standards

Confinement = restrict action of a program
	sandboxing = allows a process to read from and write to only certain memory location and resources
Bounds = each process that runs on a system is assigned a security level
Isolation = when a process in confined through enforcing access bounds

Access controls types:
	MAC: static attributes of the subject and the object determine the permissibility of an access
	DAC: subject has some ability to define the object to access
	RBAC: rule based access control		

token = separate object that is associated with a resource and describes its security attributes
capabilities list = row of security attributes for each controlled object
security label = attribute storage, generally permanent part of the object to which its attached, safeguard against tampering
Trusted Computing Base (TCB) = only subset portion of info system that can be trusted,  responsible for AC to the system
Security Parameter = imaginary bounday between TCB and the rest of the system
trusted paths = TCB secured channels to rest of the system
Reference Monitor and Security Kernel = part of the TCB, validates access to every resources prior to granted access
	stands between every subject and object

State Machine model = a system that is secured no matter what state it is in
	FSM Finite State Machine = combines an external input with an internal machine state to model all kinds of complex systems
	next state = output = F(current state, input)
	state = snapshot of a system in a specific point in time
	transitions = occur when accepting input or producing output, always results in a new state (= state transition)

Information flow model = focuses on the flow of information
Non interference Model = how the actions of a higher subject affect the system state or actions of a lower subject
Composition theory = information flows between system: cascading, feddback (reciprocates), hookup (sends input to external entities)
take-Grant Model = employs redirected graph to dictate how rights can be passed from one subject to another, or to an object
	take / grant / create / remove
Access Control Matrix = table of subject and object: column = ACL / row = Capabilities List
Bell-LaPaluda Model = write up and read down allowed, write down and read up forbidden
	provides confidentiality but not integrity nor availability
	simple security property = subject may not read info at higher security level
	* security property (= confinement property) = subject may not write information to an object at lower sensitivity level
	Discretionary security property = system uses an access matrix
Biba Model = inverted Bell model
	only integrity, no access control managment, doest not prevent covert channels
	more common choice for commercial organizations
Clark-wilson Model = uses a three-part relationship subject/program/object (or subject/transaction/object)

Chapter 9:
Security Vulnerabilities,threats and countermeasures

=======================================================================================================================================================
=======================================================================================================================================================
execution type:
multitasking = handling 2 or more task simultaneously
multiprocessing = a multiprocessor computing system harnesses the power of more than one processor to complete the execution of a single application
Massively Paralelle Processing MPP = systems house hundred or thousands of processors, each with its own OS
Multiprogramming = similar to multitasking, a way to batch or serialize multiple processes, normally coordinates by the OS
Multithreading = multiple concurrent task to be performed within a single process
	thread = self-contained sequence of instructions that can execute in parallele, and are part of the same parent process

processing type:
Single State = require use of policy mechanism to manage information at different level
Multistate = certified to handle multiple security levels simultaneously

Protection Mechanisms:
Protection Rings = organize code and components in an OS into concentric rings
	ring 0 (OSKernel/Memory) is the highest level of priviledge (kernel is the part of the OS that always resides in the memory)	
	ring 1 houses other part of the OS
	ring 2 where I/O drivers, protocols and system utilities reside
	ring 3 for applications and programs

	ring 0-2 runs in supervisory or privileged mode
	ring 3 runs in user mode
Process state (= operating state) = various form of execution in which a process can run
	supervisor state = privilege, all access mode
	problem state = associated with user mode

	Processing queue = processes line up for execution in OS
		time slice = chunk of processing time

	Ready = process is ready (= has all memory and other resources it needs) to resume or begin processing as soon as it is scheduled
	Waiting (=blocked) = ready for continued execution but is waiting for a device or access request to be serviced
	Running = executes on the CPU and keep going until it finishes, its time slice expires, or is blocked for some reason
	Supervisory = process must perform an action that requires greater privileges
	Stopped = process finishes or must be terminated (an error occurs, a required resource is not available)

new processes always transition into ready state
ready processes always transition into running state

Mode		Clearance	Need to know	PDMCL (Process Data from Multiple Clearance Level)
Dedicated	Same		None		None
System High	Same		Yes		None
Compartmented	Same		Yes		Yes
Multilevel	Diferrent	Yes		Yes
	
Operating Mode
	User mode = basic mode:	CPU allows the execution of only a portion of its full instruction set, often VM and virtual subsystem machine
	Privilege Mode = give the OS access to the full range of instructions supported by the CPU
		= Privilege mode = Supervisory mode = system mode = Kernel mode

Memory
	ROM: read but can't change, no writing allowed, burn at factory, bootstrap info on startup, includes POST
	PROM: allows end user to burn chip's contents later, no further change possible, used on custom HW app
	EPROM: small windows that, when illuminated with a special violet light erase the content or the chip
	EEPROM: electric voltages delivered to the pin forces erasure
	Flash Memory: similar to EEPROM, but can be written in blocks or page
	
	RAM = = main memory = primary memory: when computer is off, all data stored in RAM disappears
	Cache RAM = take data from slower devices and temporarily stores it in faster devices
		dynamic = capacitors, loses their charge overtime that can alter memory, needs CPU overhead for periodic operations
		static = use flip-flop as on/off switch, no need for periodic operations, more expensive

Memory adressing
	Registers = limited amount of memory onboard the CPU, that is used by ALU Arithmetic Logical Unit
	Immediate Adressing = a way of referring to data that is supplied to the CPU as part of an instruction
	Direct Addressing = provides the CPU the actual address to the memory location to access
	Indirect Addressing = the memory address contains another memory address
	Base+Offset addressing = uses a value in one of the CPU's registers as base location and add the offset

Secondary Memory = magnetic, optical, flash-based media
	paging = reads the data from disk back into real memory
	memory functions in nanoseconds, disk in milliseconds

Memory Security Issues
	memory retention issues = delete or erase all ROM,PROM,EPROM,secondary memory
	RAM could retain some of their charge for a limited period in time...
	attack can freeze memory chips to delay the decay or resident data
	most important issues is to control who may access data stored in memory while a computer is in use

Storage
	Primary memory = primary storage = RAM
	Secondary storage =  secondary storage = long term storage device
	Volatile = lose data when power off
	Nonvolatile = dont lose data when power off
	Random (storage access) = allow OS to read and write immediately from any point within the device, using adressing system
	Sequential = require to read all the data physically stored prior to the desired location

Storage media security
	data remanence = data remain on secondary storage device after it has been erased
	sanitizing = use specialized utilities to destroy all trace of data on the the device, or damage or destroy it beyond possible repair

Input and Output device
	Monitors: shoulder surfing or TEMPEST vulnerability < electronic emanation (> Van Eck phreaking)
	printers: exposed to network, store data locally (often Harddrive)
	Modems: can create alternate egress channel

Input/Output Structures
	Memory mapped I/O
	IRQ Interrupt Request = assigning specific signal lines to specific device through special interrupt controller
		older PC: 0-16 with 2 cascaded 8-line interrupt
		newer PC: 0-23 with 3 cascaded 8-line interrupt

Client Based
	Applets	= code objects are sent from a server to perform some actions on the client
	Java applets = platform-dependant programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, create sandbox concept; implement JVM
	ActiveX Controls = Microsoft aswer to Java, use: Visual Basic, C, C++, Java, no sandbox
	Local Cache = anything temporarely stored on the client for future use, ARP cache, DNS cache, Internet Files cache
ARP
	ARP used to resolve an IP address into the appropriate MAC address
	ARP poisoning = respond to ARP broadcast queries in order to send back falsified replies
	static ARP are permanenet to reboot
HOST Poisoning
	HOSTS files = static file found on TCP/IP supporting system that contains hardcoded references for domain names and associated ip adresses
	admin or hackers can add relationship from FQDN Fully Qualified Domain Name and IP address
	DNS query Spoofing = eavedrop's on a client's DNS queries, then send client false information

Server-Based
	Aggregation = combine records from multiple tables
	aggregation attacks = collect numerous low-level security items and combine to create something of a higher security level or value
	Inference = use human mind's deductive capability rather than raw mathematical ability of modern database platform
	Data mining and Data Warehousing = allow analysts to comb though data warehouse and look for potential correlated information
	Grid Computing = form of paralleled distributed processing

essential security protection mechanisms
Layering = implement a structure similar to ring model for operating mode and apply it to each operating system process
Abstraction = users just need to know the detail of the box but only the proper syntax for using the object, based of object-oriented programing
Data Hiding = assures that data existing on a security level is not visible to process running at a different security level
Process Isolation = requires that OS provide separate memory locations for each processs instructions and data

Common Architectue Flaws and Security Issues
Covert Channels	= method to pass information over a path that is not normally used for communication
Covert Timing Channel = conveys information by altering the performance of a system component or modifying a resource's timing in a predictable manner
Covert Storage Channel = conveys information by writing data to a common storage area where another process can read it
called backdoor or maintenance hook = avoid security measures by design
Initialization and Failure States = many systems unload the security measures as part of their shutdown procedures
data diddling = attacker gains acces to a system and make small, random, incremental change to data
salami attack = very small amounts are deducted from assets from balances regularly and routinely
TOCTOU attack or race conditions = difference between TOC and TOU is sometimes large enough ofr an attacker to replace the original object with another

		CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol)
			used over PPP (Point to Point Protocol) link
			encrypts usernames and passwords
			use a challenge-response dialogue that cannot be replayed
			periodically reauthenticates the remote system

		PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)
			standardized authentication protocol for PPP
			no encryption of usernames and passwords
			provide a means to transport the logon credentials from the clients to the authentication server

		EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)
			more like a framework for authentication than a protocol
			allows customized authentication security solutions (smart cards, tokens,biometrics)


Voice over Iternet Protocol (VoIP)
		VoIP encapsulates audio into IP packets
		potential attacks:
			Caller ID can be falsified > viphing (VoIP fishing) or SPIT (Spamm over Internet Telephony)
			Call manager systems and VoIP phones vulnerable to host OS and DoS attack
			Spoofing call manager or endpoint connection negotiations > man-in-the-middle
			deploying VoIP on the same switch as servers and desktop servers > 802.1X authentication falsification / VLAN and VoIP hopping
			decoding VoIP traffic when it's encrypted

Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
		authentication through X.509 digital certificates
		encryption through PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standard)	
		provide:
			signed message: integrity, sender authentication and nonrepudiation
			enveloped message: integrity, sender authentication and confidentiality

MIME Object Security Services (MOSS)
	CIA and nonrepudiation
	MD2 and MD5 algorithms
	RSA public key and DES 

Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
	CIA and nonrepudiation
	RSA DES and X.509

	Plan Remote Access Security
		
		Remote connectivity Technology: 
			each type of connection has its unique security issue
			include DSL, ISDN, wireless networking, satellite, and cable modems
		
		Transmission protection: 
			encrypted protocol, connection system, network services or applications
			include VPNs, SSL, TLS, Secure Shell, IPSec, L2TP				

		Authentication Protection
			Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
			CHAP, EAP, LEAP, PEAP, RADIUS
			Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)
			
		remote User assistance
			Network Access Control (NAC)
			use of callback and caller ID:
				callback: disconnect a remote user upon initial contact and immediatly attemps to reconnect to them using a predefined phone number (= number defined in the user account's security database)
				Caller ID: potentially verifying the physical location of the authorized user

Dial-Up Protocol
	secure authentication is needed, adding option for data encryption is preferred
	PPP and SLIP provide link governance, for dial-up and some VPN links
		PPP = full duplex protocol used for transmitting TPC/IP packets over various non-LAN connections (modem, ISDN, VPN, Frame relay...)
		protected by CHAP and PAP
		= replacement for SLIP, can support any LAN protocol, not just TCP/IP

	SLIP = Serial Line Internet Protocol
		older techno to support TCP/IP over asynchronous serial connections (as serial dial-up or modem dial-up)
		support only IP
		require static IP addresses
		no error detection or correction, no compression

	MNP = Microsoft Networking Protocol
		found in Microcom modem in the 1990s
		own form or error control called Echoplex

Centralized Remote Authentication Services
	add layers of security between remote user and private network
	ex.: TACACS+ and RADIUS
		provides seperation of the authorization and authentication process for remote clients

	RADIUS
		remote access user passes user dial-up logon credential to the RADIUS server for authentication
		similar to domain clients sending logon credential to a domain controller for authentication

	TACACS
		= alternative to RADIUS
		3 versions: TACACS, Extended TACACS (XTACACS) and TACACS+
		XTACACS provide separate process for authentication, authorization and accounting
		TACACS+ improve XTACACS, most current and relevant version

Virtual Private Network
	= communication tunnel that provide point-to-point transmission of both authentication and data traffic over an intermediary untrusted network
	commonly associated with establishing secure communication paths through the internet between two distant network
	can link 2 network or 2 individual systems

	Tunneling
		= network communication process that protects the contents of protocol packets by encapsulating them in packets of another protocol
		virtual path exist between the encapsulation and deencapsulation entities
		can be used if the primary protocol is not routable and to keep the total number of protocol supported on the network to a minimum
		ex.: sending a letter, access a website through SSL or TLS connection, VoIP

		but:
		creates larger packets or more packets, can saturate a network
		point to point communication, don't handle broadcast traffic
		makes difficult to monitor the traffic

	How VPN Works
		can be established over any other network communication connections
		acts like a typical direct LAN cale connection (only difference: speed)
		can connect 2 individual systems or 2 entire networks
		data only protected in the VPN tunnel
		remote access server and firewall act as a endpoint and starting point for VPN
		
	Common VPN protocols
		software or hardware solution
		layer 2: PPTP, L2L, L2TP 
		IPsec
		PPTP and IPsec are limited for use on IP networks
		SSL/TLS can also be used as a VPN protocol
		
		Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
			developed from PPP
			operates at layer 2
			used on IP networks
			create a Point-to-Point tunnel and encapsulates PPP packets
			support same authentication protocol than PPP: MS-CHAP, CHAP, PAP,EAP, SPAP
			initial tunnel initiation process is not encrypted > abused by interception
			often replaced by L2TP,which use IPsec which use traffic encryption for VPN

		Layer 2 forwarding Protocol and Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
			L2F, developed by Cisco
				mutual authentication tunneling mechanism
				does not offer encryption
				not widely deployed and replaced by L2TP

			L2TP derived by combining L2T and PPTP
				creates a point-to-point tunnel
				relies on IPsec for encryption (commonly used)
				support TACACS+ or RADIUS	

		IP Security Protocol
			IPsec = most common protocol used
				= stand alone VPN protocol and the security mechanism of L2TP
				used only for IP traffic
				provides encryption and secured authentication
				2 primary components:
					authentication Header (AH): authentication, integrity and nonrepudiation
					Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): 
						layer 3
						transport mode: only encrypt IP packets data, not the header
						tunnel mode: entire IP packet encrypted + new header added 

Switching Technologies
	
	Circuit Switching
		= originally developed to manage the telephone calls over public switched telephone network
		dedicated physical pathway is created between the 2 communicating parties
		once call establish, path remain the same during the communication

		Real-world circuit switching = POTS and PSTN, gone with digital switching and VoIP

	Packet Switching
		communication or message broke into small segment (usually fixed-lenght packets) sent accross intermediary networks to destination
		each segment has a header with source and destination

			packets may use diffent SVC from source to destination

WAN Technologies

	Fault tolerance < deploy 2 redundant connections, from possibly 2 different telco or service provider	

	dedicated line: (= leased line or point-to-point link)
		link between the customer's LAN and dedicated WAN is always open and established
		connected 2 specific endpoints and only those two endpoints
		cost based on distance

		ex.:
		Techno					Connection Type		Speed
		Digital Signal Level 0 (DS-0)		Partial T1		64Kbps to 1.544 Mbps

	WAN Connection Technologie
		border device = channel service unit / data service unit (CSU/DSU)	
			contains data terminal equipment/data circuit-terminating equipment (DTE/DCE) = connection point for the LAN's router  (DTE) and WAN carrier network's switch (DCE)
		CSU/DSU acts like a translator, store and forward device
		carrier networks, or WAN connection technology: X.25, Frame Relay, ATM, SMDS

		X.25 WAN connection
			= older packet-switching technologie, widely used in europe
			permanent virtual circuit
			predecessor to Frame Relay
			lower performance and throughput compared to Frame Relay and ATM

		Frame Relay Connections
			packet switching techno, use PVC
			supports multiple PVC over a single WAN carrier service connection
			layer 2 connection mechanism
			requires use of DTE/DCE at each connection point
			customer owns DTE, provider owns DCE
			cost based on the amount of data transfered 
			CIR (Commited Information Rate) = guaranteed minimum bandwidth by provider
				may by overthrow over short intervals: bandwidth on demand
			
		ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
			= cell-switching WAN communication techno
			connection-oriented packet-switching techno
				fragments communication into fixed-lenght 53-bytes cells > very efficient and high thoughput
			use either PVC or SVC	
			
		SMDS (Switched Multimegabit Data Service)

		HSSI (High Speed Serial Interface)
			= DTE/DCE interface standard
			defines how routers and multiplexors connect to high-speed network carrier services (as ATM or Frame Relay)
			layer 1

	Prevent or Mitigate Network Attack
		
		DoS and DDoS
			preventing legitimate activity on a victimized system
				attack exploiting a vulnerability in HW or SW
				attack that flood the victim's communication pipeline with garbage network traffic
			
			most DoS employ intermediary system (usually unwilling and unknowing participant) to hide attacker from the victim
			bots, zombies or agents = remote-control tools installed onto secondary victim systems
			attacks involving Zombies = Distributed DoS (DDoS)
			
			countermeasures:
				add firewalls routes and IDS that detects DoD
				maintain contact with provider, to request filtering services when DoS occurs
				disable echo replies on external systems
				disable broadcast features on border systems
				block spoofed packets from entering or leaving the network
				keep systems updated
				consider commercial DoS protection/response
					Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation or Prolexic

		Eavesdropping
			= listen communication traffic to duplicate it
			usually requires a physical acces to implement a physical device or extraction program
			often facilitated by sniffer (traffic capture or monitoring program, or protocol analyzer system)
			difficult to detect < =passive attack
			tools ex.: wireshark, Netwitness, T-Sight, Zed Attack Proxy, Cain and Abel
			
			countermeasures:
				physical access security
				encryption
				one-time authentication methods
				
		Impersonation/Masquerading
			=  act of pretending to be someone or something you are not
			usually implies that authentication credentials have been stolen of falsified
			different from spoofing (false identitty without any proof)

			countermeasure:
				one-time pads
				token authentications, using Kerberos
				using encryption to increase difficulty of extracting authentication

		Replay Attack
			= reestablish a communication session by replaying captured trafic against a system
			
			countermeasures:

			often an element of man-in-the-middle attack

			countermeasures:
				defining static ARP mappings for critical systems
				monitoring ARP caches
				use IDS

		DNS Poisoning, Spoofing and Hijacking
			= resolution attack
			alter domain-name-to-IP-address mappings on DNS server

Chapter 13
Managing Identity and Authentication

subject = active entity that accesses passive object to receive information from, or data about , an object
object = passive entity that provide information to active subject

Types of access control:
	preventive access control = thwart or stop unwanted or unauthorized activity to occur
	detective access control = discover or detect unwanted or unauthorized activity
	corrective access control = modifies the environment to return systems to normal after an unwanted or unauthoized activity has occured
	deterrent access control = discourage security policy violations (depends on individual deciding not to take an unwanted action)
	directive access control = direct, confine or control the action to force or encourage compliance with security policies
	compensation access control = alternative when its not possible to use a primary control; or increase the effectiveness of a primary access control

Type of access control implementation:
	administrative access control = policies and procedures
	Logical/technical controls = hardware or software mechanisms
	Physical control = items that can be physically touch

Authorization factors
	type 1: something you know
	type 2: something you have
	type 3: something you are or something you do
	type 4: somewhere you are

Smartcard = credit-card size ID or badge that has an integrated circuit chip embedded
Tokens	= password generating device that users can carry with them
	synchronous dynamic password tokkens: time-based and synchronized with an authentication server
	asynchronous dynamic pasword tokens: doesnt use clock, based on algorithm and incrementing counter

Biometric Factor Error Ratings
	type 1 error = valid subject is not authenticated > False Rejection Rate (FRR)
	type 2 error = invalid subect is authenticated > False Acceptance Rate (FAR)
		
	compare the overall quality of biometric device with Cross Error Rate (CER)

Kerberos (current version v5)
	= tickets authentication system that employs a third-party entity to prove identification and provide authentication
	offers single sign-on solution for users and provides protection for loggon credentials
	relies on symetric-key cryptography using AES protocol
	
	Key distributor center = trusted third-party that provides authentication services
		uses symmetric cryptography to authenticate clients to server
		all clients and servers are registered to KDC
		maintains secret key for all network members

	Kerberos Authentication Server = hosts the functions of the KDC: TGS and AS
		ticket-granting services (TGS): possibly being installed on an another server
		authentication services (AS):  verifies or rejects the authenticity and timeliness of tickets
		server often called as the KDC

	Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) = provides proof a subject has authenticated to the KDC and is authorized to request tickets to access other objects
		encrypted and includes a symmetric key, expiration time, and user's IP address
		subjects present the TGT when requesting tickets to access objects

	Ticket = encrypted message that provides proof that a subject is authorized to access an object
		sometimes called a service ticket (ST)
		subjects requests tickets to access objects, if they are authenticated and are authorized to access objects, Kerberos Issues them a ticket
		have specific lifetimes and usage parameter

	process work of Kerberos:
		1. user types username and password into the client
		2. client encrypts the username with AES for transmissions to the KDC
		3. KDC verifies the username against a database of known credentials
		4. KDC generates a symmetric key that will be used by the client and the kerberos server. Encrypts with a hash of the user password
			KDC also generate a time-stampeded TGT
		5. KDC transmits the encrypted symmetric key and the time-stamped TGT to the client
		6. the client installs the TGT for use until it expires, client also decrypts the symmetric key using a hash of the user's password
			
		Note: the client's password is never transmitted over the netork, but it is verified

		when client wants to access the subject:
		1. client send its TGT back to the KDC with a request to access to the resource
		2. KDC verify the TGT is valid and check its access control matrix for client's privilege to the resource
		3. KDC generate a service ticket and sends it to the client
		4. client sends the ticket to the server or service hosting the resource
		5. server or service hosting the resource verifies the validity of the ticket with the KDC
		6. once Id and authorization verified, the server or service opens a session with the client and begins communications or data transmission

	Kerberos = versatil authentication mechanism that works over local LANs, remote access, and client-server resource request
	SPOF = KDC, if KDC is offline, no one can access resources
	all systems must be time-synchronized over 5 min of each other

Federated Identity Management and SSO
		
	Federated Identity management = SSO for internet
	multiple organization can join a federation, or group
	often use the Security Assertion Make Up Language (SAML) or Service Provisioning MArkup Language

	Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
		commonly used to display static web pages
		derived from the  Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and Generalized Markup Language (GML)
		describes how data is displayed using tags to manipulate size and color of the text: ex.: <H1>I passed the CISSP exam</H1>
					
	Extensible Markup Language (XML)
		display the data by describing the data
		include tags to describe data as anything desired ex.: <ExamResults>Passed</ExamResults>
		databases from multiple vendor can import and export data to and from an XML format
		many specific schemas have been created so that companies know exactly what tags are being used for specific purposes

	Security Assertion Make Up Language (SAML)
		XML-based language that is commonly used to exchange Authentication and Authorization (AA) information between federated organizations
		often used to provide SSO capabilities to browser access

	Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML)
		newer framework based on XML, specifically designed for exchanging user information for federated identity single sign-on purposes
		based on Directory Service MArkup Language (DSML), which display LDAP-based directory service information in an XML format

	Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML)
		used to define an Access Control policies within an XML format
		commonly implements role-based access controls

AAA Protocols
	Authentication, Authorization and Accountability service = AAA services
	used in VPN, local networks or Mobil IP

	RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)
		centralizes authentication for remote connections
		used by many internet service providers (ISP)
		users call in, and after authentication, RADIUS server terminates the connection and initiates a call back to the user's predefined phone number
		use the UDP and encrypt only the exchange of the password
		defined in RFC 2865

	TACACS+
		alternative to RADIUS
		separate Authentication, Authorization and Accountability, that can be hosted on different servers
		encrypts all of the authentication information
		TACACS and XTACACS use UDP port 49
		TACACS+ uses TCP port 49

	Diameter
		= new version of RADIUS
		built on RADIUS and TACACS
		suppports wide range of protocols, like IP, VoIP and Mobile IP
		not backward compatible to RADIUS
		uses TCP port 3868 or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) port 3868			
		support IPsec and TLS encryption

======================================================================================================================
Chapter 14
Controlling and Monitoring Acccess

======================================================================================================================

Understanding Authorization Mechanisms

	implicit deny = ensures that access to an objects is denied unless access has been explicitly granted to a subject
	Access Control Matrix = tables that includes subject, objects and assigned privileges,	objects focused
	Capability Tables = different from ACL because they focus on subjects, subject focused
	Constrained Interface (or restricted interface)	= applications use constrained interface to restrict what users can do
	Content-dependant control = restricts access to data based on the content whitin an object (ex.: database view)
	Context-dependant control = requires specific activity before granting user access, ex.: data flow for a transaction 
	Need to know = subjects are granted access only to what they need to know for their work tasks and job functions
	Least Privileges = subjects are granted only the privileges they need to perform their work tasks and job functions
	Seperation of Duties and Responsabilities = sensitive functions are split into tasks performed by 2 or more employees

Discretionary Access control (DAC)
	allows owner, creator, or data custodian of an object to control and define access to that object
	Ex.: user create a new spreadsheet, that user is owner of the file. this user can modify permissions of the file to grant access to other users

	DAC is implemented using ACLs on objects
	doesnt offer centrally controlled management system
	admin can suspend user privileges while they are away, or disable accounts when they leave the organization
	= very flexible

Nondiscretionary Access Control
	administred by administrators, that change access controls that affect the entire environment
	acces doest not focus on user identity, but a static set of rules governing the whole environment manages access

role-based access control (or task-based access control)
	define a subject's ability to access an object based on the subject's role or assigned tasks
	often implemented using groups
	helps enforce the principle of least privilege by preventing privilege creep
	privilege creep = tendency for privilege to accrue to users over time aas their roles and access needs change
	usefull in dynamic environment with frequent personnel changes 

Task Based Access Control (TBAC)
	similar to role-BAC
	= each user is assigned an array of tasks
			
rule-based access control
	uses a set of rules, restrictions, or filters to determine what can and cannot occur on a system
		includes granting a subject access to an object, or granting the subject ability to perform an action
		have global rules that apply to all subjects
	ex.: Firewall: include a set of rule + a final rule (= implicit deny rule)

attribute based access control  (ABAC)
	= advanced implementation of rule-BAC
	use policies that include multiple attributes for rules
	ex.: CloudGenix defines a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) solution that implements policies to allow or block traffic

Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
	= relies on the use of classification labels
	each classification label represents a security domain, or realm of security
		
	security domain = collection of subjects and objects that share a common security policy
	subjects are only able to access objects with the secret label, when they have a matching secret label
	subjects have labels assigned to them based on their clearance level, which is a form of privilege
	the requirement for subjects to gain the secret label is the same for all subjects
	
	often referenced as a lattice-based MAC model
	
	allows labels to identify more defined security domains:
		within confidential section, they are 4 separate security domains labels Lentil, Foil, Crimson, and Matterhorn
		users with confidential label also require tle additional label to access data within these compartments

	assures "need to know" principles
	prohibitive rather than permissive, uses an implicit deny philisophy
	MAC model more secure than the DAC model but not as flexible and scalable

	Classifications:
		Hierarchical Environment: 
			relates various classification labels in ordered structure from low security to high security
			clearance in one level grants the subject access to objects in that level and below, but prohibits access to object above

		Compartmentalized environment
			no relationship between one security domain and another
			subject need specific clearenace for the security domain of the object
	
		Hybrid Environment
			combines both hierarchical and compartmentalized

Advanced persistent threat (APT) = group of attackers who are working together and are highly motivated, skilled and patient
impersonation attack = logging in as the user and accessing the user's resources

Common access control attacks
	Access aggregation attacks = collecting multiple insensitive information and aggregate them to learn sensitive information
	Password attacks
		strong passwords helps prevent password attacks
		more common for an attacker to steal the account database and then crack the passwoords offline

	Dictionnary attacks	
		= attempts to discover passwords by using every possible password in a predefined database or list of common or expected passwords
		one-upped-constructed password = previously used password, but with one character different
			= often used approach to build rainbow tables

	Brute-Force Attacks
		= systematically attempting all possible combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols
		usually programs that can automatically try all the combinations
			
		passwords and username are commonly stored in an account database file on secured systems
			systems and applications commonly hash passwords and store the hash values
			users authenticate by hashing the password prior to send it the system, sytem compares the hash values		
				> password dont cross the network in clear form
				> password databases do not store passwords in clear text
		12-character password using 4 character types can take thousands of years to crack

	Birthday Attacks
		= focuses on finding collisions
		names comes from the statistical phenomena called 'the birthday paradox' 
		reduce the success of birthday attacks by using hashing algorithms and salts (rainbow tables)

	MD5 is no more collision free
	SHA-3 use 512bits and is considered collision free, for now

	Rainbow Table Attacks
		= uses of large database of pre-computed hashes to reduce time of guessing a password and its hash
		the password cracker simply compares hashes until it find a match
		14 character with 4 types of characters > 7.5GB rainbow table
		15 character with 4 types of characters > beat most rainbow tables
 
		many systems salt passwords to reduce effectiveness of rainbow tables
			salt = group of random bits , addded to a password before hashing it		
			
	Sniffer Attacks
		or snopping attack, or eavesdropping attacks
		sniffing captures a packets sent over a network with the intent of analyzing the packets
			
		Countermeasures:
			encrypt all sensitive data
			use one-time password when ecnryption is not possible
			protect network device with physical security
			monitor the network for signatures from sniffers

	Spoofing Attacks or masquerading = pretending to be someone, or somthing, else
	Social engineering attack = gain the trust of someone by using deceit, such as false flattery or impersonation
	shoulder surfing = placed filters over a monitor, password masking
	Phishing = giving up sensitive information by opening an attachment or clicking a link
	Spear phishing = form of phishing targeted to a specific group of users, such as employees within a specific organization
	Whaling	= variant of phishing that target senior or high-level executives such as CEOs and presidents withi a company
	Vishing	= phishing via Instant Mesaggers and VoIP
	Smartward Attacks = side-channel attack is a passive, non invasive attack intended to observe the operation of a device
	Denial-of-Service Attacks = prevents the system from processing or responding to legitimate traffic or requests for resources

Summary of protection methods
		
	Control physical access to systems
	Control electronic access to files
	Encrypt password files
	Create a strong password policy
	Use Password masking
	Deploy Multifactor authentication
	Use account lockout controls: lock an account aftr incorrect password is entered a predefined number off times
		typically use clipping levelsthat ignore some user errors but take action after reaching a threshold
	Use last logon notification
	educate users about security

Security Assessment and testing

Performing Vulnerability Assessment

	Vulnerability Scans
		automatically probe systems, application and networks, looking for weaknesses that may be exploited by an attacker
		scanning tools provide quick, point-and-click tests or scheduled scanning without requiring manual intervention
				
	Network discovery Scan
		uses a variety of techniques to scan a range of IP addresses, searching for systems with open network ports
		
		TCP SYN Scanning: 
			or "half-open" scanning
			sends a single packet to each scanned port with SYN flag set, this indicate a request to open a new connection
			if the scanner receive the SYN and ACK flag set, system is moving to the second phase in the three-way TCP handshake and that the port is open. 
			
		TCP Connect Scanning
			opens a full connection to the remote system on the specified port
			used when the user running the scan doesnt have the necessary permissions to run a half-open scan

		TCP ACK scanning
			sends a packet with the ACK flag set, indicating that it is part of an open connection

		Xmas scanning
			sends a packet with the FIN, PSH, and URG flags set

		nmap is the most common tool
			released in 1997
			identifies the current state of each network port on the system, providing a status:
				open: port open and there is an application actively accepting connections on that port
				closed: port accessible on the remote system, meaning the firewall is allowing access, but no application accepting connections on that port
				filtered: nmap unable to determine if the port is open or closed because firewall is interfering with the connection attempts

	Network vulnerability scanning
		dont stop on detecting open ports but continue on to probe a targeted system or network for the presence of known vulnerabilities
		contains databases of thousands of known vulnerabilities
	
		false positive report = vulnerability shown on nmap but there is no problem
		false negative report = misses a vulnerability and fail alert the administrator

		authenticated scans of systems = scanner has read-only access to the server, can use it to access read configuration information from the target system and use that information when analyzing vulnerability  testing results
			reduce false positive and false negative reports

Preventing and responding to incident

======================================================================================================================

Defining an incident = any event that have a negative effect on a CIA of an organizatio's assets.
	ITIL v3: un unplanned interrution in IT Service or a reduction in the quality of IT service
	computer security incident = result of an attack, or the result of malicious or intentional actions on the part of users
	RFC 2350: security incident and computer seecurity incident = any adverse event which compromises some aspects of computer or network security
	NIST 800-61: a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practice

Incident Response Steps
	Detection > Response > Mitigation > Reporting > Recovery > Remediation > Lesson Learned
		  ^------------------------------------------------------------|
	NIST SP 800-61: Preparation > Detection and Analysis > Containment, eradication and recovery > postincident recovery

Understanding attacks
	
	Denial of Service Attack = prevent a system from processing or responding to legitimate traffic or requests for resources and objects
		DDoD: Distributed Denial of Service = multiple systems attacks a single system at the same time
	SYN flood attack = common DoS attack
		disrupt the standard three-way handshake used by TCP to initiate communication sessions
			send pultiple SYN packets but never complete the connection with an ACK
			each SYN packet provoke the server to send a ACK/SYN back
			server often wait for ACK for as long as 3 min, leaving an incomplete session, taht consumes resources
			attacker often spoof a the source adress, each SYN comes from a different address
				
			IDS and firewalls often include mechanisms				
			using SYN cookie is one method of blocking the attack
			reduce time of waiting the ACK		
			
	TCP reset attack = spoof sender and send a RST packet > session need to be reestablish, and data may need to be recreated

	Smurf and Fraggle attack = DoS attacks
		floods the victim with ICMP echo packets instead of with TCP SYN packets
		= spoof broadcast ping request using the IPaddress of the victim as the source IP address
		take advantage of an amplified network (= smurf amplifier) by sending a directed broadcast through a router
		RFC 2644 (in 1999) changes the standard default for configure router not to forward directed broadcast traffic
			> limit smurf attack to a single network
		common to disable ICMP on firewalls, routers and servers to prevent any attack using ICMP

	fraggle atack = similar to smurf attacks
		uses UDP packets over UDP ports 7 and 19

	Ping Flood = flood a victim with ping requests
		very effective using botnets (as a DDoS attack)
		counter by blocking ICMP traffic
			IDS can detect a ping fllod and modify environment to block ICMP traffic during the attack

	Botnets	= robots or zombies
		bot herder = criminal who controls all the computer in the botnet via commands and control servers
		computers often oin a botnet after being infected by a molicious code of software
		botnet of over 40000 computers are relativly common, 1M of systems have been seen in the past
		some bot herders control more than 1 botnet
		counter: use anti-malware software, keep browser and plug-in up-to-date
	
	Ping of Death =	employs an oversized ping packet: over 64KB (ping packets are normally 32B or 64B)

	teardrop = attackers fragment traffic in such a way that a system is unable to put data packets back together
		counter: patches, IDS can detect the malformed packets

	Land Attack = attackers send SYN packets to a victim using the victim's IP address as both the source and the destination IP address
		tricks the system into constantly replying to itself and cause it to freeze, crash or reboot
		discovered in 1997 and resurfaced attacking different ports
		counter: keep system up-to-date, filtering traffic with identical source and destination addresses

	Zero-day exploits = attacking a vulnerability that is unknown to others
		attacker first discovers a vulnerability: common definition of zero-day exploit

)	Malicious code = any script or program that performs an unwanted, unauhtorized, or unknown activity on a computer system
		= virus, worms, trojan horses, documents with destructive macros, and logic bombs
		distributed: in the past: floppy disks, hand-carried from system to system, today: drive-in downloads
		drive-in download = code downloaded and installed on a user's system without the user's knowledge
			counter: keep system up-to-date
			Zeus spread to drive-by downloads and phishing attempts and stole credentials for bank sites
			Gumblar redirected users to another site, which then download and open an infected PDF file

	Man-in-the-middle = attacker a position between the 2 end-points of an ongoing communication
		can copy or sniff the traffic > sniffing attack
		act as a store-and-forward or proxy mechanism > attacker can collect logon credentials and sensitive data, or change the messages exchanged
			need impersonate the client from the server, and the server from the client
			often need a combination of multiple attacks
				-alter routing information and DNS values
				-falsify ARP lookup

			counter: keep system out-to-date with patches
					IDS cant usually detect this attack, but can detect abnormal activities occurring over communication links

	War Dialing = using a modem to search for a system that accepts inbound connection attemps
		dial phone numbers and listen for computer carrier tones
		can search any range of numbers
		newer form: uses VoIP to make calls without use of modems
		Metasploit incorporated an update version of WarVOX = war-dialing tool that uses VoiP
		counter: 	imposing strong remote access security (including strong authentication), 
				using callback security, ensuring that no unauthorized modems, resctricting what 
				using call logging
		
	Sabotage
		= destruction or disruption committed by an employee
		counter:	employee termination should be handle swiftly, account access should be disabled as soon as possible
				intensive auditing, monitoring, keeping lines of communication open between emplyees and managers

	Espionage
		= malicious art of gathering propriatery, secret, private, sensitive or confidential information

IDS and IPS
	IDS:
		intrusion occurs when an attacker bypass or thwart security mechanisms and gain access to an organization's resources
		effective method of detecting DoD and DDoS attacks
			can raise alarms and send alerts
			automates the inspection of logs and real-time system events
			can modify the environment to stop an attack

	IPS:
		all the capability of an IDS but can also take additional steps
		user can disable extra features to make it function as a IDS
				
	often referred as IDPS

	Kwowledge and Behaviour based  detection: use signatures detection
	behaviour-base compare activity against a baseline of normal performance
		or statistical intrusion detection, or anomaly detection or heuristic-based detection
		create a baseline over a limited time of activity (usually 1 week)
		some continue to monitor the activity and update the baseline
		but: often raise a high number of false alarms, false alerts or false positive

Specific Preventive Measures
	Honeypots/Honeynets = individual or networked computers created as a trap for intruders
	Pseudo Flaws = false vulnerabilities or apparent loophole intentionnaly implanted in a system in an attemp to tempt attackers
	Padded Cells = similar to honeypot = simulated environment that offers fake data to retain an intruder's interest
	Warning Banners
	Anti-malware
	Whitelisting (app allowed) and Blacklisting (app blocked)
	
	Firewalls = provide a protection to a network by filtering traffic
		based on IP addres, port, protocol
		include rules with ACL
		
		application-level gateway firewall filters traffic based specification application requirement
		circuit-level gateway firewalls filters traffic based on the communication circuit
		stateful inspection firewalls and dynamic packet filtering firewalls, filter traffic based on its state within a stream of traffic
			
		next-generation firewall funtions as Unified Threat Management (UTM)
			combine several filtering capabilities
			able to perform packet inspection techinques

	Sandboxing = security boundary for applications and prevents the application from interacting with other applications


Clipping Level	= form of nonstatisitcal samplings
	select only events that exceed a clipping level, which is a predefined threshold for the event
	often associated with a form of mainframe auditing known as violation analysis: system is monitored for error occurences
	nonstatistical sampling is discretionary sampling (or sampling at the auditor's discretion)
		less expensive and easier to implement than statistical sampling
		less reliable and mathematically less defensible

Steganography = embedding a message within a file
Watermarking = embedding an image or pattern in paper that ins't readily perceivable

	remote mirroring = live database is maintained at the backup site

Backup and Offsite Storage
	Full Backups: full copy of the data contained on the protected device
		duplicate all the files on the system regardless of the setting of the archive bit
		once complete, archive bit of all files is reset, turned off, or set to 0

	Incremental Backup: store only those file that have been modified since the time of the most recent full or incremental backup
		only files that have the archive bit turned on, enabled, or set to 1 are duplicated
		once complete, archive bit of all files is reset, turned off, or set to 0

	Differential Backup: store all files that have been modified since the time of the most recent full backup
		only files that have the archive bit turned on, enabled, or set to 1 are duplicated
		does not change the archive bit
	differential take less time to restore, but longer to create
	
	Using Backup: 
		full backup on Monday, and differential backups every other night of the week:
			failure on Saturday morning: restore full backup of Monday and differential of Friday
		full backup on Monday, and incremental backups every other night of the week:	
			failure on Saturday morning: restore full backup of Monday and each incremental backup of the week, in chronological order

	Backup tape format:
			rotation cycle = frequency of backup and retention lenght of protected data

		use the weaker preponderance of the evidence standard, demonstrate that the outcome of the case is more likely than not
	Regulatory Investigations = when individual or corporation has violated administrative law
	Electronic discovery = applies to both paper records and electonic records
		
Evidence
	prosecute attorney must provide sufficient evidence to prove an individual guilty beyond a reasonable doubt

	+ actions taken should not change that evidence
	+ person that access to original digital evidence should be trained for the purpose
	+ all activity relating to the seizure, access ,storage, or transfer of digital evidence must be fully documented, preserved, and available for review
	+ an individual is responsible for all action taken with respect to digital evidence while it is in their possession
	+ any agency that is responsible for seizing, accessing, storing, or transferring digital evidence is responsible for compliance with these principles

search warrant = 4th amendment outlines the burden placed on investigators to have a valid search warrant
	warrant can be issued only based on probable cause, must be specific in their scope

Conducting the investigation
	never conduct investigation on an actual compromised system: take system offline, make backup to use in investigation
	never attempt to hack back and venge a crime

advanced persistent threats (APT): nation-state, organized, crime, terrorist group  > highly effective attacks against a very focused target
